                                Need to perfect your Webdriver Cucumber skills? BDD also referred to as â€˜Behaviour
                                    Driven Developmentâ€™ is a great way to test and simulate different user scenarios,
                                    for example what happens if you try to use the following contact us form (Click the
                                    button to access the challenge) to simulate user(s) inputting different types of
                                    data or how about attempting to simulate a user submitting information to the form
                                    using an email address in the incorrect â€˜Mandatoryâ€™ format?

                                Are you really an actually user of webdriveruniversity.com? Do you really have a
                                    valid username and password? Cucumber enables us to validate multiple sets of
                                    username(s) and password(s) with ease by using scenarios outlines and examples! Give
                                    the challenge a try! 
                            
                        
                    

                
                        
                            
                                BUTTON CLICKS
                            
                            
                                WebElement Click, JavaScript Click, Actions Move &amp; Click!
                                Simulating various types of user click(s) can be a very tricky task within Selenium
                                    Webdriver, there are many types of clicks available and itâ€™s also important to learn
                                    and test for yourselves the importance of each type of click. Why not attempt the
                                    challenge that awaits, can you perform all the required webdriver clicks?
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                TO DO LIST
                            
                            
                                Task1 [ ] - Task2 [ ] - Task3 [ ] - Task4 [ ] - Task5 [ ]
                                Have you perfected the craft of combining multiple user actions in one? The following
                                    â€˜To Do Listâ€™ can be a tricky one! Luckily Selenium webdriver comes packed within
                                    many types of features and libraries which can be very useful! Ready to attempt this
                                    challenge? Can you use Selenium Webdrivers bespoke send keys method to add to the
                                    existing list? Or even delete an existing item from the list?
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                PAGE OBJECT MODEL
                            
                            
                                Design a robust framework which is maintainable and reusable!
                                Page object model (POM) is a fantastic design pattern which can be used to construct
                                    the architecture of your framework(s); enabling the developer to replicate specific
                                    pages of a given website. Pages can be modelled into unique classes (Java classesâ€¦)
                                    in the process enabling test framework(s) to become more maintainable, flexible and
                                    reusable. Can you use the concepts of Page Object Modelling to model the pages of
                                    the website in this challenge? 
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                ACCORDION &amp; TEXT AFFECTS (APPEAR &amp; DISAPPEAR)
                            
                            
                                Click on one of the accordion panels! Do you see any text?
                                Accordions are great way to toggle between hiding and showing large amount of
                                    content; waiting for specific items to appear such as text can be quite tricky! I
                                    suggest practising wait commands here!
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                DROPDOWN, CHECKBOXE(S) &amp; RADIO BUTTON(S)
                            
                            
                                The choice is yours!
                                Dropdown lists, check boxes and radio button are very common across websites now days
                                    and there are a wide range of options to select from. Try to handle each of the
                                    options listed within the challenge that awaits, itâ€™s important to practise,
                                    practise and practise in order to home your selenium webdriver skills.
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                AJAX LOADER
                            
                            
                                Wait..... for the Ajax Loader
                                Webdriver waits can be a very very tricky task to understand let alone attempt to
                                    implement! All automation testers must perfect the craft of webdriver waits! Itâ€™s
                                    not only important to implement the code required to practise the necessary waits,
                                    itâ€™s essential that you also understand the different types of waits which are
                                    available. The following challenge will present an Ajax load screen however are you
                                    callable of implementing webdriver wait(s) to click on the button which will appear
                                    once the Ajax loader vanishes?
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                ACTIONS
                            
                            
                                Can you really handle this challenge?
                                The webdriver actions class enables the developer to perform a wide range of distinct
                                    user actions whether itâ€™s trying to perform double click(s), click and hold(s) or
                                    even attempting to drag and drop a specific element(s), have fun with the following
                                    challenge! I know I would ðŸ˜Š

                                Scrolling Around...
                                Sometimes we need to scroll to a specific element on a webpage before we conduct
                                    specific actions to that element. Letâ€™s say the developer needs to simulate a user
                                    click but the element is positioned at the bottom of the page? Luckily for us we can
                                    use custom JavaScript code to scroll too specific coordinates of a page or even
                                    scroll directly to a specific element which is in an awkward position of a website.

                                Close those annoying Popup &amp; Alerts!
                                At times Popup and alerts can be quite annoying especially when they can impact the
                                    results of your automation test scripts. There are various types of popups and
                                    alerts which are present such as â€˜JavaScriptâ€™ alerts or even â€˜Modalâ€™ popups. Once
                                    you understand the way to handle such popups and alerts the process can be straight

                                    easy once you get the hang of it.

                                Can you extract data to an Excel file?
                                Sometimes we may need to read or even write data from a website to an external file
                                    such as an Excel file / sheet. Apache POI is an open source piece of kit which comes
                                    bundled with Java libraries enabling the developer to more effortlessly read or
                                    write data from external sources. Experiment with the data tables, can you capture
                                    data from one of the tables and in turn write that data to an excel sheet?

                                Searching for something specific?
                                Often we are uncertain of what we are searching for! Using the enlisted suggested
                                    search textfield, you will be able to search for a specific product, based upon your

                                Need to perfect your Webdriver Cucumber skills? BDD also referred to as â€˜Behaviour
                                    Driven Developmentâ€™ is a great way to test and simulate different user scenarios,
                                    for example what happens if you try to use the following contact us form (Click the
                                    button to access the challenge) to simulate user(s) inputting different types of
                                    data or how about attempting to simulate a user submitting information to the form
                                    using an email address in the incorrect â€˜Mandatoryâ€™ format?

                                Are you really an actually user of webdriveruniversity.com? Do you really have a
                                    valid username and password? Cucumber enables us to validate multiple sets of
                                    username(s) and password(s) with ease by using scenarios outlines and examples! Give
                                    the challenge a try! 
                            
                        
                    

                
                        
                            
                                BUTTON CLICKS
                            
                            
                                WebElement Click, JavaScript Click, Actions Move &amp; Click!
                                Simulating various types of user click(s) can be a very tricky task within Selenium
                                    Webdriver, there are many types of clicks available and itâ€™s also important to learn
                                    and test for yourselves the importance of each type of click. Why not attempt the
                                    challenge that awaits, can you perform all the required webdriver clicks?
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                TO DO LIST
                            
                            
                                Task1 [ ] - Task2 [ ] - Task3 [ ] - Task4 [ ] - Task5 [ ]
                                Have you perfected the craft of combining multiple user actions in one? The following
                                    â€˜To Do Listâ€™ can be a tricky one! Luckily Selenium webdriver comes packed within
                                    many types of features and libraries which can be very useful! Ready to attempt this
                                    challenge? Can you use Selenium Webdrivers bespoke send keys method to add to the
                                    existing list? Or even delete an existing item from the list?
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                PAGE OBJECT MODEL
                            
                            
                                Design a robust framework which is maintainable and reusable!
                                Page object model (POM) is a fantastic design pattern which can be used to construct
                                    the architecture of your framework(s); enabling the developer to replicate specific
                                    pages of a given website. Pages can be modelled into unique classes (Java classesâ€¦)
                                    in the process enabling test framework(s) to become more maintainable, flexible and
                                    reusable. Can you use the concepts of Page Object Modelling to model the pages of
                                    the website in this challenge? 
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                ACCORDION &amp; TEXT AFFECTS (APPEAR &amp; DISAPPEAR)
                            
                            
                                Click on one of the accordion panels! Do you see any text?
                                Accordions are great way to toggle between hiding and showing large amount of
                                    content; waiting for specific items to appear such as text can be quite tricky! I
                                    suggest practising wait commands here!
                            
                        
                    


                
                        
                            
                                DROPDOWN, CHECKBOXE(S) &amp; RADIO BUTTON(S)
                            
                            
                                The choice is yours!
                                Dropdown lists, check boxes and radio button are very common across websites now days
                                    and there are a wide range of options to select from. Try to handle each of the

                                Wait..... for the Ajax Loader
                                Webdriver waits can be a very very tricky task to understand let alone attempt to
                                    implement! All automation testers must perfect the craft of webdriver waits! Itâ€™s
                                    not only important to implement the code required to practise the necessary waits,
                                    itâ€™s essential that you also understand the different types of waits which are
                                    available. The following challenge will present an Ajax load screen however are you
                                    callable of implementing webdriver wait(s) to click on the button which will appear
                                    once the Ajax loader vanishes?

                                The webdriver actions class enables the developer to perform a wide range of distinct
                                    user actions whether itâ€™s trying to perform double click(s), click and hold(s) or

                                Scrolling Around...
                                Sometimes we need to scroll to a specific element on a webpage before we conduct
                                    specific actions to that element. Letâ€™s say the developer needs to simulate a user
                                    click but the element is positioned at the bottom of the page? Luckily for us we can
                                    use custom JavaScript code to scroll too specific coordinates of a page or even
                                    scroll directly to a specific element which is in an awkward position of a website.

                                At times Popup and alerts can be quite annoying especially when they can impact the
                                    results of your automation test scripts. There are various types of popups and
                                    alerts which are present such as â€˜JavaScriptâ€™ alerts or even â€˜Modalâ€™ popups. Once

                                Simulating various types of user click(s) can be a very tricky task within Selenium
                                    Webdriver, there are many types of clicks available and itâ€™s also important to learn
                                    and test for yourselves the importance of each type of click. Why not attempt the
                                    challenge that awaits, can you perform all the required webdriver clicks?

                                Design a robust framework which is maintainable and reusable!
                                Page object model (POM) is a fantastic design pattern which can be used to construct
                                    the architecture of your framework(s); enabling the developer to replicate specific
                                    pages of a given website. Pages can be modelled into unique classes (Java classesâ€¦)
                                    in the process enabling test framework(s) to become more maintainable, flexible and
                                    reusable. Can you use the concepts of Page Object Modelling to model the pages of
                                    the website in this challenge?

                                Click on one of the accordion panels! Do you see any text?
                                Accordions are great way to toggle between hiding and showing large amount of
                                    content; waiting for specific items to appear such as text can be quite tricky! I
                                    suggest practising wait commands here!

                                The choice is yours!
                                Dropdown lists, check boxes and radio button are very common across websites now days
                                    and there are a wide range of options to select from. Try to handle each of the
                                    options listed within the challenge that awaits, itâ€™s important to practise,
                                    practise and practise in order to home your selenium webdriver skills.

                                Wait..... for the Ajax Loader
                                Webdriver waits can be a very very tricky task to understand let alone attempt to
                                    implement! All automation testers must perfect the craft of webdriver waits! Itâ€™s
                                    not only important to implement the code required to practise the necessary waits,
                                    itâ€™s essential that you also understand the different types of waits which are
                                    available. The following challenge will present an Ajax load screen however are you
                                    callable of implementing webdriver wait(s) to click on the button which will appear
                                    once the Ajax loader vanishes?

                                The webdriver actions class enables the developer to perform a wide range of distinct
                                    user actions whether itâ€™s trying to perform double click(s), click and hold(s) or

                                Sometimes we need to scroll to a specific element on a webpage before we conduct
                                    specific actions to that element. Letâ€™s say the developer needs to simulate a user
                                    click but the element is positioned at the bottom of the page? Luckily for us we can
                                    use custom JavaScript code to scroll too specific coordinates of a page or even
                                    scroll directly to a specific element which is in an awkward position of a website.

                                At times Popup and alerts can be quite annoying especially when they can impact the
                                    results of your automation test scripts. There are various types of popups and
                                    alerts which are present such as â€˜JavaScriptâ€™ alerts or even â€˜Modalâ€™ popups. Once
